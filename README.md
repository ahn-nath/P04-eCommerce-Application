# E-Commerce Application
To demonstrate the security and DevOps skills that I learned in a lesson, I downloaded the template for an e-commerce app written in Java and added some implementations. 
- Demonstrated correct handling of authorization with proper security using JWT.
- Wrote tests and met an acceptable code coverage level (above 80%).
- Identified the correct metrics for logging, in order to monitor a system.
- Manually indexed metrics to Splunk.
- Configuration and automation of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Tech
Some of the technologies used for the new version of the project:
* [Java SE Development Kit 8+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments.
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - software project management and comprehension tool
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)  - collaboration platform for API development
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - framework providing dependency injection, web framework, data binding, resource management, transaction management, and more.
* [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) - sn in-memory database used in this project to run unit tests.
